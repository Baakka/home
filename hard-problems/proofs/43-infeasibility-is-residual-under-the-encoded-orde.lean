# Hard Problems, Chapters 1 and 10: the problem object and the navigation contract

Formalization of the mathematical core of the book draft
"Hard Problems: Compositional Navigation in Open, Partially Observable, Adaptive Systems".

Design choices, recorded once and referenced from the review:

* Probability is represented with `PMF` (countably supported distributions).
  The book allows general measurable spaces; everything here generalizes to
  `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel` at the price of measurability side conditions that
  would obscure the decision-theoretic content. This matches the book's own
  remark in section 0 about finite-dimensional notation.
* The model class `Θ` is a fixed unknown parameter type. The book writes a
  time-indexed `θ_t`; see the review (finding on section 1) for why the two
  readings, epistemic uncertainty versus drift, should be separated.
* Policies are typed on observation histories. The book's admissible action
  sets `A_i(s)` depend on the unobserved state, which a history-typed policy
  cannot check; the review flags this as a gap in the text.

  G : S → Fin k → ℝ
  /-- per-agent payoffs `G_i`: the realized rewards `r_i` that drive
  adaptation in chapter 8. The focal agent's own objective is the
  vector-valued `G` above; nothing requires the non-focal `G_i` to be known
  to the focal agent. -/

/-- A maintained focal-view model `M = (θ, π₋₀)` (chapter 3). The other agents'
reactions are folded into single-agent kernels. This folding is sound only when
the non-focal policies are Markov in the current state; the review discusses
what breaks otherwise (their internal histories become hidden confounders). -/

/-- Chapter 1.1: the hardness profile `H(P) = (F, O, A, L, Ru, Re, X)`.
Each coordinate is a diagnostic claim (a proposition to be argued from
evidence), not a score. Ruggedness lives on the configuration graph and
evaluation of `Ruggedness.lean`; reversibility is recovery reachability in
the sense of `Dynamics.lean`'s `Recoverable`. -/

  latency : Prop
  ruggedness : Prop
  reversibility : Prop

/-- The profile's index. The named tuple above is presentation; the
underlying object is an indexed family of diagnostic claims, so extending
the profile means adding an index point, not changing an arity. The
coordinates are moreover not primitive: agency, reversibility, and
ruggedness are one diagnostic (constrained reachability) evaluated at three
re-descriptions of the problem, latency is observability with a clock
(`obsLag_ne_top_iff`), and reflexivity is observability plus agency on the
augmented system (`extendStep_fst`). Formulation alone resists absorption:
it is governance, prior to the system. -/

  | observability
  | agency

carries no structure beyond its index. -/

/-- The knowns/unknowns matrix as a projection of the profile: a cell
records only whether the destination is settled (formulation) and whether
the current state is estimable (observability). The matrix is an on-ramp,
not a measure; the two theorems below make that precise. -/

a cell and differ in the remaining coordinates. -/

/-- Every cell is fat: any combination of the five remaining diagnostics
occurs inside any given cell. A "known to known" problem can still be
arbitrarily rugged, laggy, irreversible, and reflexive; the cell says where
to start looking, not what will be found. -/

/-! ## Chapter 10: the stopping rule

The book lists four terminal conditions: execute, probe, escalate, exit.
As stated they are not mutually exclusive (a problem can be feasible for the
focal agent while the objective choice belongs to another authority), so a
deterministic stopping rule needs a priority order. We encode the natural one
and prove the characterizations, which makes the exclusivity explicit. -/

/-- The four verdicts of the chapter 10 stopping rule. -/

  | execute
  | probe
  | escalate
  | infeasible

/-- The three findings the stopping rule branches on. -/

  else if a.reducibleCriticalUncertainty then .probe

    a.verdict = .execute ↔ a.feasibleRobust = true := by
  unfold Assessment.verdict

/-- Infeasibility is exactly the failure of all three positive findings:
the rule never declares infeasibility while a live option remains. -/

    a.verdict = .infeasible ↔
      a.feasibleRobust = false ∧ a.reducibleCriticalUncertainty = false ∧
        a.authorityElsewhere = false := by
  unfold Assessment.verdict
  split_ifs <;> simp_all

/-! The stopping rule, generalized: chapter 10 notes that the priority
order is itself a governance choice. `verdictOfList` is the rule for an
arbitrary declared order (an ordered list of findings paired with
verdicts, and a residual), and the two theorems are what any such rule
owes its users. (Proofs found by Harmonic's Aristotle; see
`aristotle/pool/verdict/`.) -/

/-- A stopping rule as an ordered list of findings paired with verdicts,
and a residual verdict when nothing fires: first match wins. -/
def verdictOfList {V : Type*} (rules : List (Bool × V)) (residual : V) : V :=
  match rules with
  | [] => residual
  | (b, v) :: rest => if b then v else verdictOfList rest residual

/-- The residual is declared exactly when every finding is negative
(provided no rule reuses the residual verdict): the rule never declares
infeasibility while a live option remains, for any declared order. -/

    rcases p with ⟨b, v⟩
